            I’m a game programmer based in Hamburg-Germany, focused on building systems, tools, and gameplay logic.<br>
            I’m currently pursuing my Master’s degree in Game Design, 
            where I’ve worked on several diverse projects, including one large-scale game featured in my portfolio.<br><br>
            
            Previously, I spent two years at Neox Studios as a working student. I worked on two commercial projects, coding core features, 
            building tools that help the workflow, setting up game logic, collaborating closely with artists and designers to bring ideas to life.<br><br>

            Curious by nature, I’m always eager to learn, but I also love applying what I know to create something new. Whether it’s perfecting a mechanic, 
            making a puzzle click, or shaping a feature, I enjoy the whole process.<br><br>

            For me, game development is a blend of problem solving, teamwork, and playful experimentation! Paired with a constant drive to explore new coding 
            techniques, design ideas, and ways to grow my skills. That’s what keeps me excited to open my editor every day.

          To select a rout, player have to kick the map tabel and 
          figure out, which Island they want to visit. They have to decide between 4 diffrent reward types, more gold for their treasure, repait or upgrade their ship. 
          For all players that want to gamble a little, we added a question mark, hiding the true treasure on that island (which is gold, repair or upgrade).<br><br>

            You set up each shot just to your desires — position the camera where you want it, tweak any Cinemachine settings until it feels right, and save.

            <b>The star</b>: showing the current shot.<br>
            <b>The scout</b>: already checking if the next planned shot is usable.<br><br>
                  
            To test a shot, it checks whether all key “points of interest” on the actor (like the head by default, but you can define others) 
            are inside the camera’s view. If they are — perfect, we roll. If not, the system automatically adjusts the camera within your predefined limits.<br><br>
                  
            If no shot within the limits works, it switches to a fallback angle. 
            And if even the fallback fails (which can happen in ultra-tight close-ups), it cleverly hides the inactive actor 
            and temporarily places the camera where their head would be — keeping the scene immersive without breaking the shot.<br><br>

            This shader was an assignment project for my Master’s.`,
          howItWorks: `Starting with the water depth, the shader checks the distance of an object to the water plane in world space. This returns the value, 
            how deep under the water an object is, regardless of the camera position. This value allows to lerp a shallow and a deep water color, for a nice gradient effect.<br>

            <br><br>
            For the underwater distortion the shader uses the same depth check, to figure out if an object is below or above the surface.<br>
            It uses UV maps, with a simple noise texture which is moving to create the distortion effect.<br><br>
                    
            Next is adding surface foam, this is a simple texture displayed on the face of the plane.<br>
            I added a distortion function in hsls for the foam, to simulate it interacting with the waves.<br>
            As well as intersection foam. The intersection foam uses a little trick, the shader takes a small depth check of the object like in the depth check described above,
            this time it checks in camera direction. The shader has another noise texture displayed on the face, but cutoff by the depth value of the object. Allowing a fade for the 
            intersection foam.<br>

            <br><br>
            The last thing I added for the assignment where waves. I added a hsls function to move vertices with Gerstner wave. These move vertices in e circular loop, which leads to a nice roll effect of the wave.<br><br>
                    
            For the game Punchy Pirates, I added some additional feature, like wave height fade. Allowing the top of the wave to have a lighter color then the lower parts, these differences can be set by a cutoff value and a fade value. The surface foam also reacts to the height fade with its transparency. Leading to the final result of the water shader.

          We used a default Oculus-VR headset, for the actual gameplay of sorting the trash in the different bins. 
          For trash to spawn, we used different sensors, connected to an arduino that sends the signal via WiFi to the pc the game runs on, where in-game trash spawns. `,
          howItWorks: `The sensors are sending an input, which is received on the pc, our game runs on. The pc reads the input as spacebar. We then added the spacebar input in Unity, to spawn trash.<br><br>

                The green, purple and blue trash types need to be sorted in their same colored bin. to do so, a players has to enter the game in VR, aim the controller in the direction of the trash and hold the grab button, to collect it.<br> The game uses physics, which make the throwing part interesting. 
                When ever the trash in the game is to much, the Trash-o-meter starts its sirens, signaling that someone has to take action and sort the trash.<br><br>
