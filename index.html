            I’m a game programmer based in Hamburg / Germany, focused on building systems, tools and gameplay logic.<br>
            I’m currently pursuing my master’s degree in games, 
            where I’ve worked on several diverse projects, including one large-scale game featured in my portfolio.<br><br>
            
            Previously, I spent two years at Neox Studios as a working student. I worked on two commercial projects, coding core features, 
            building tools that help the workflow, setting up game logic, collaborating closely with artists and designers to bring ideas to life.<br><br>

            Curious by nature, I’m always eager to learn, but I also love applying what I know to create something new. Whether it’s perfecting a mechanic, 
            making a puzzle click, or shaping a feature, I enjoy the whole process.<br><br>

            For me, game development is a blend of problem-solving, teamwork, and playful experimentation! Paired with a constant drive to explore new coding 
            techniques, design ideas, and ways to grow my skills. That’s what keeps me excited to open my editor every day.

          while repairing their ship whenever sharks create holes.<br>
          The project followed a non-lethal, kid-friendly approach, aiming to create a game that could be enjoyed by the whole family,
          including players with little to no gaming experience.<br><br>

To achieve this, we designed simple controls and provided players with clear hints and guidance throughout the gameplay. 
Our approach was successfully validated at the Baltic Games Fest, where many attendees had the opportunity to play and enjoy our game.<br><br>

          Difficulty is determined by the length of the chosen route, encouraging strategic decision-making on our open map.<br><br>

          To select a route, players kick the map table and choose which island to visit. They must decide between four reward types:
          additional gold for their treasure, repairing their ship, upgrading their ship, or taking a gamble on a “?” island, which hides the true reward.<br>
          Players also need to manage their resources carefully, balancing upgrades and repairs to ensure they have enough gold to purchase the map piece at the end of the run.<br><br>

          Once the round begins, the ship sets sail and enemies appear: one attempts to steal players’ gold, another bites holes in the ship, and a third targets the players directly, 
          trying to knock them off board.<br><br>

            You set up each shot just to your desires, position the camera where you want it, tweak any Cinemachine settings until it feels right, and save.

            <b>The star</b>: showing the current shot.<br>
            <b>The scout</b>: already checking if the next planned shot is usable.<br><br>
                  
            To test a shot, it checks whether all key “points of interest” on the actor (like the head by default, but you can define others) 
            are inside the camera’s view. If they are, perfect, we roll. If not, the system automatically adjusts the camera within your predefined limits.<br><br>
                  
            If no shot within the limits works, it switches to a fallback angle. 
            And if even the fallback fails (which can happen in ultra-tight close-ups), it cleverly hides the inactive actor 
            and temporarily places the camera where their head would be, keeping the scene immersive without breaking the shot.<br><br>

          This shader was an assignment project for my master’s.`,
          howItWorks: `The water shader starts by calculating the depth of objects relative to the water plane in world space. This value determines how far under the water an object is, 
          independent of camera position, and is used to interpolate between shallow and deep water colors, creating a smooth gradient effect.<br>

            <br><br>
            For underwater distortion, the shader reuses the depth calculation to determine whether an object is above or below the surface. Using UV maps combined with a moving noise texture, it generates a dynamic distortion effect.

            Surface foam is added using a simple texture applied to the plane’s face. I implemented a distortion function in HLSL to simulate interaction with the waves, along with intersection foam.<br> 
            The intersection foam uses a depth-based trick: it samples object depth along the camera direction and applies another noise texture cut off by the depth value, 
            allowing the foam to fade naturally where objects intersect the water.<br>

            <br><br>
            Finally, waves are simulated by moving vertices with a Gerstner wave function, producing a realistic rolling effect. For Punchy Pirates,
            I added additional features like wave height fade, allowing the wave tops to appear lighter than lower areas. The surface foam responds to these height variations, adjusting transparency for a more dynamic and realistic water effect.

          about: `This project is part of my master's study program. We had the guideline to make any game, but with unusual inputs.<br> 
                  We used a default Oculus VR headset for the actual gameplay of sorting the trash in the different bins. 
                  For trash to spawn, we used different sensors connected to an Arduino that sends the signal via WiFi to the PC the game runs on, wherein-game trash spawns. 
                  Wheneverthe trash in the game is too much, the Trash-o-meter starts its sirens, signaling that someone has to take action and sort the trash.<br><br>`,
          howItWorks: `
          The sensors send input signals that are received by the PC running the game. The PC interprets these signals as a spacebar press, 
          which we used in Unity to spawn trash.<br><br>

          Players must sort green, purple, and blue trash into their corresponding bins. In VR, players aim the controller at the trash and hold the grab button to collect it. 
          The game’s physics system makes throwing and sorting objects dynamic and engaging, adding an extra layer of challenge and fun.<br><br>
