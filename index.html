            code to learn about generating meshes and colliders. I extendet some
            scripts, to fit my needs, added vegetation generation as well as the

          <p>
            A sensoria (Arduino) project, where different sensores like pressure
            plates and proximity sensores are placed in a real room. Everytime a
            sensor is triggered it sends a signal to an Wifi-Arduino, which is
            connected to the machine, running the Trash Game, translating the
            signal into input, which spawns trash.
